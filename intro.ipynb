    "**Definition**: A computer program is said to *learn* from experience **E** with respect to some class of tasks **T** and performance measure **P**, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this sounds too abstract, and it should, an example will hopefully make it clearer. Suppose we want to write a program that learns to play [the game of Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game). The program should improve its performance as measured by its ability to win at the class of tasks involving playing Go games, through experience obtained by playing games against itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, to have a well-defined learning problem, we must identify these three features: the class of tasks, the measure of performance to be improved and the source of training experience. In our Go example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Task T**: playing Go.\n",
    "* **Performance measure P**: percentage of games won against opponent.\n",
    "* **Training experience E**: playing practice against itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every single Machine Learning problem, the very same nomenclature will apply: in order to learn to do something well we need first to define that something (the task), define a suitable success (failure) measure and maximize (minimize) it through the inspection of a collection of training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general it's not possible to directly maximize the perfomance measure, thus we need to optimize a related quantity, usually referred to as the **loss** or **objective function**. For regression problems this can be, for example, the mean squared error. For classification problems the most frequently encountered, but by no means the only one, is the **categorical cross-entropy**. We don't need to go into any detail, but it's important to know that this is the quantity that we directly operate on."

It consists of 70,000 images of 28 by 28 pixels representing handwritten digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test images. Our goal is to create a system that can predict what the handwritten number in an image is. Our inputs are the pixel intensities. This means that we will have 28x28 = 784 inputs and 10 outputs, corresponding to the 10 digits 0,...,9. Our approach follows very closely [Xavier Snelgrove's tutorial](https://github.com/wxs/keras-mnist-tutorial/blob/master/MNIST%20in%20Keras.ipynb).\n",
